A minimalist wordpress theme aimed at creating a visually-pleasing portfolio for Game Devs like me.  Based off of starter theme, [underscores](https://underscores.me/), and css theme, [Bulma](https://bulma.io/).  Also utilizes icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

Versioning

This theme uses a version naming scheme similar to [Unity](https://unity.com/): `[Year].[Feature].[Bug Fix]`

- `[Year]` - indicates the year the theme was released
- `[Feature]` - a 1-indexed number indicating the number of feature releases in that year.
- `[Bug Fix]` - a 0-indexed number indicating the number of bug-fix release building on top of a prior feature release.
