This theme uses a version naming scheme similar to [Unity](https://unity.com/): `[Year].[Feature].[Bug Fix]`

- `[Year]` - indicates the year the theme was released
- `[Feature]` - a 1-indexed number indicating the number of feature releases in that year.
- `[Bug Fix]` - a 0-indexed number indicating the number of bug-fix release building on top of a prior feature release.
